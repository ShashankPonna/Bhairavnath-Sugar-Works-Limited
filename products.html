            <p>
                The <strong>Government of India</strong> has actively promoted the co-generation of power from
                <strong>bagasse</strong>, aiming to
                improve returns for sugar factories and contribute to electricity generation. <strong>Bhairavnath
                    Sugar
                    Works Limited</strong> utilizes bagasse — a by-product of sugarcane — to generate power
                primarily for <strong>captive
                    consumption</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this process, <strong>bagasse is burned in boilers</strong> to produce steam. The steam generated
                through
                <strong>bagasse-fired water-tube boilers</strong> is fed to turbines for power generation, and the
                exhaust steam is
                then used in the sugar manufacturing process. This dual use of steam — for power generation and
                sugar processing — is known as <strong>co-generation</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bhairavnath Sugar Works Limited places a strategic focus on co-generation, especially as the
                nationwide demand for electricity continues to rise. Bagasse, being rich in <strong>calorific
                    value</strong>, serves
                as an excellent <strong>non-conventional renewable fuel</strong> source.
            </p>
            <p>
                The company operates <strong>four power plants</strong> located at <strong>Sonari, Vihal,
                    Lavangi</strong>, and <strong>Alegaon</strong> units, with a
                total power generation capacity of <strong>53 MW</strong>. The co-generation plant at
                <strong>Sonari</strong> was established in
                <strong>2008-09</strong> with a capacity of <strong>14.5 MW</strong>. This was followed by
                <strong>Vihal (12 MW)</strong> in <strong>2011-12</strong>, <strong>Lavangi (14.5 MW)</strong>
                in <strong>2013-14</strong>, and <strong>Alegaon (12.5 MW)</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Out of the total power generated, <strong>11 MW</strong> is utilized internally, while the remaining
                is sold to
                <strong>Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL)</strong> under an
                <strong>Energy Purchase
                    Agreement (EPA)</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The co-generation plants operate during both the <strong>sugarcane crushing season</strong> and the
                <strong>off-season</strong>,
                utilizing saved bagasse to ensure continuous power generation.
            </p>
            <p>
                For sugar factories like Bhairavnath Sugar Works Limited, co-generation offers multiple benefits:

                Molasses, the by-product generated during the manufacture of sugar, is fermented and distilled to
                manufacture various alcohol variants.
            </p>

            <p>
                The policies for setting up Ethanol plants are becoming increasingly supportive both at the Centre
                and
                in Maharashtra. Recently, the Ministry of Petroleum and the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA)
                signed
                a MoU to supply alcohol from sugar mills to petroleum companies. Earlier restrictions have been
                lifted,
                and a 5% ethanol blending is now mandatory for oil companies. Around 40% of alcohol produced is used
                for
                potable purposes, while the remaining 60% serves industrial and ethanol needs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Utilizing molasses for ethanol production not only adds value but also ensures better price
                stability
                and realization for sugar mills. This enhances their viability and ultimately benefits cane growers.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Bhairavnath Sugar Works Limited</strong> has ambitious plans in this domain—not just as a
                business opportunity, but also to promote the green energy that ethanol offers.
            </p>

            <p>
                The company has established a 30 KLPD ethanol plant alongside a dedicated boiler and turbine to
                provide
                steam and power for the plant. The facility is located at Sonari, Taluka Paranda, District
                Osmanabad,
                Maharashtra.
            </p>

            <p>
                This integrated project will use molasses as the main raw material. A separate boiler and turbine
                will
                meet the plant's energy requirements. With excellent irrigation in the command area, raw material
                supply
                is ensured. The 30 KLPD plant will employ advanced fermentation, multi-pressure distillation
                systems,
                bio-gas recovery, evaporation, and composting.

                Fly Ash is the residual output from the boiler furnace after bagasse has completely burnt out.
            </p>
            <p>
                This bagasse ash is generally spread over farms or dumped in ash ponds, which causes environmental
                problems.
                Research has also shown that workplace exposure to dusts from the processing of bagasse can lead to
                chronic
                lung conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis, more specifically known as bagassosis. Consequently, there
                is a
                great need for its reuse. Additionally, bagasse ash is high in silica, so it can be used as a substitute
                for
                construction materials.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, this fly ash is used as a substitute for firewood. Being rich in potassium, it is also
                valued
                by local farmers for cultivation.

                <strong>Molasses</strong>, from the Latin word <em>melaceres</em>, meaning "honey-like", is a thick dark
                syrup and an important by-product of the sugar industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the sugar-making process, juice extracted from sugarcane or sugar beets is boiled down until the
                sugars crystallize and precipitate out. The only by-product obtained during repeated crystallization is
                this leftover syrup — molasses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Molasses is mainly used for the manufacture of alcohol, yeast and cattle feed. Alcohol in turn is used
                to produce ethanol, rectified spirit, potable liquor and downstream value added chemicals such as
                acetone, acetic acid, butanol, acetic an-hydride, etc.

                <strong>Press mud</strong> is commonly known as filter cake / press cake and is used as manure by
                the farmers. Press mud is the residue of the filtration of sugarcane juice. The clarification
                process separates the juice into a clear juice that rises to the top and goes to manufacture, and a
                mud that collects at the bottom.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is combustible and also used in brick kilns for brick making. When mixed with the spent wash
                generated by the distilleries, the resultant product is enriched organic manure, which has the
                capability to improve yields in farms. The use of filter cake as a soil conditioner is common among
                sugar planters.

                <strong>Bagasse</strong>is the residue obtained from crushing cane in the sugar factory. It contains 50%
                moisture & 2% sugar & the balance is fibre. Historically, bagasse waste has been burned in the fields,
                and thereby creating pollution. For each 10 tonnes of sugarcane crushed, a sugar factory produces nearly
                3 tonnes of wet bagasse. By making use of bagasse sugar industry have been successful in reducing
                dependence on State Electric Boards, for their power supply as it can procure up to <strong>90-95% of
                    its total power</strong> requirement through captive generation from steam turbines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whereas bagasse is primarily used to meet the captive requirement of fuel, a substantial quantity of it
                can be saved and diverted for use in other industries. Inside a sugar plant, bagasse is generally used
                as a combustible in furnaces to produce steam, which in turn is used to generate power. The composition
                and quality of bagasse varies based on the variety of sugarcane, maturity of cane, method of harvesting
                and the efficiency of the sugar factory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bagasse is also used as a raw material by the paper industry. The manufacture of paper from Bagasse is
                an environment-friendly alternative over the conventional route of extracting pulp from trees. By
                adopting bagasse products, you indirectly help in reducing the pollution and energy consumption.
