        <p>
            A sugarcane harvester is a large piece of agricultural machinery used to harvest and partially process
            sugarcane. The machine cuts the stalks at the base, strips the leaves off, and then cuts the cane into
            segments. These are then deposited into either the on-board container, or a separate vehicle traveling
            alongside. Waste material is then ejected back onto the field, where it acts as fertilizer.
        </p>
        <p>The machine can harvest about 80 to 100 tons/day in the present prevailing conditions, by which large area
            can be harvested within a minimum time.</p>
        <p>In 2014, company purchased Seven Sugar Cane Harvesting Machineries. For smooth & easy communication we have
            divided our area of operation on the basis of availability of sugarcane. Necessary qualified & experience
            staff is employed for harvesting transportation management same staff is also guiding to the farmers for
            cultivation the incentive crops in general. Generally every year our Season starts in the month of October
            and we harvest Sugarcane as per the date of plantation basis. Because in winter season cane is fully matured
            & get higher recovery. For transportation of sugarcane, we are also using bullock cart, trucks and tractor
            with trollies which facilitate by Karkhana, under an agreement with transporters.
